<h1 id="week-2-learning-check-in-data">Week 2 learning check-in data</h1>

<p><em>Note: The following information was as accurate as on  2023-08-08 10:45:52 (the last activity in the dataset after syncing).</em></p>

<p>On week 2, learning check-ins were embedded in the studio notebook. Students were encouraged to check in at 4 points of time during the studio session with the lecturers. After syncing the data on 2023-08-08, here is some general information I found (<strong>before cleaning the data</strong> - so the data might not be as accurate, but will give you some idea about the data):</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are 4 check-ins in the notebook.</li>
  <li>Data for 123 students were recorded. » We have 142 students enrolled, which means 19 students haven’t even used the Jupyter environment.</li>
  <li>56 students completed at least 1 check-in. » Less than half of the students used the check-in function :’(</li>
  <li>Most students were confident - as most students had a mean confidence level above 8.</li>
  <li>13 students completed at least 4 check-ins. The majority checked in 3 times. 25 students checked in once or twice. However, at this stage, not all check-ins are genuine. I need to do more data cleaning.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="check-ins-during-week-2-studio-sessions">Check-ins during Week 2 studio sessions</h2>

<p>This is the first experience of student learning check-in. The information below only used the data from week 2’s studio notebook and included the activities during the studio session (Monday morning 9:00 am - 11:00 am). Later, I may check the data again and I may include data from outside the studio session time. The new data may provide some information about students who watched the recordings or attempted the tasks by themselves outside the studio session time. :</p>

<ul>
  <li>34 students checked in at least once during the live studio sessions.</li>
  <li>Only 4 students completed all 4 check-ins during the studio session.</li>
  <li>In general, students were quite confident about their learning for the session, as the mean confidence levels for a majority of students were above 7.</li>
  <li>By roughly observing individual inputs, there were not many changes in the confidence levels during the session. This might be because there were not enough check-ins for the session to show some patterns.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>Potential issues that need to be solved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some students ran the check-in code in other notebooks</li>
  <li>One student ran 4 check-ins within 2 minutes</li>
</ul>

<p>What else to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Visualise the confidence levels of each participant</li>
  <li>Modelling confidence levels</li>
  <li>A more close examination of the time spans for check-ins</li>
  <li>Adding students who checked in outside the studio session</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="week-7-observations">Week 7 observations</h1>

<p>Data was synced in the morning of 2023-09-05. The latest record in this sync was 2023-09-04 22:37:18.</p>

<p>Quick notes on the data:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Now we have 140 students in the dataset. Changed from 123 on week 2.</li>
  <li>Among all the 140 students, 101 students have completed at least 1 check-in.</li>
  <li>Among all the data, several students have an average of 10 out of 10 for their check-ins.</li>
  <li>In general, the average confidence level for most students were reasonably high (above 5). Only a few students had an average confidence level below 5.</li>
  <li>For the last 7 weeks, we have 3 sessions with check-ins: Week 2, Week 4 and Week 7. The maximum number of check-ins should be 13. Based on all the data, majority students who checked in less than 12 times. However, 14 students checked in more than 13 times.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="before-looking-into-week-7-data-lets-start-with-week-4">Before looking into week 7 data, let’s start with week 4</h2>

<p>Instead of looking for only live studio sessions, let’s start by looking for the whole week. So it potentially includes students who checked in outside the studio sessions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>111 students logged into the Jupyter environment on week 4.</li>
  <li>76 students checked in at least once during the week.</li>
  <li>The majority of students who checked in this week had a mean confidence level above 6. 8 students had a mean confidence level below 6, one student was 1.6.</li>
  <li>5 check-ins in the notebooks for this week. The majority checked in 5 or less times. 16 students checked in more than 5 times.</li>
</ul>

<p>During studio sessions only:</p>
<ul>
  <li>60 students logged into the Jupyter environment during the studio sessions.</li>
  <li>53 of them checked in during the studio sessions.</li>
  <li>Similar patterns than the whole week data. 8 students had a mean confidence level below 6, one student was 1.6. [CHECK] Are they the same students?</li>
  <li>5 check-ins in the notebooks for this week. The majority checked in 5 or less times. 9 students checked in more than 5 times.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="week-7-data">Week 7 data</h2>

<p>Since this is still at the beginning of Week 7, so I am going to look at the check-ins during the live studio sessions only.</p>

<p>During studio sessions only:</p>
<ul>
  <li>49 students logged into the Jupyter environment during the studio sessions.</li>
  <li>44 of them checked in during the studio sessions.</li>
  <li>Similar patterns from previous weeks. 6 students had a mean confidence level below 6, one student was 2.2.</li>
  <li>4 check-ins in the notebooks for this week. Almost half of the students (n=20) checked in more than 4 times.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="is-the-check-in-data-useful-for-quantum-modelling--a-very-early-stage-of-exploration">Is the check-in data useful for quantum modelling? – A very early stage of exploration</h1>

<h2 id="data-preparation">Data preparation</h2>

<p>Defining a learning session: From my understanding, when we discussing quantum modelling, we are talking about the state when a learner is in their state of learning. Therefore, it is important to consider that the modelling is going to pick up learner’s confidence level during one learning session. Therefore, I am considering that each week’s studio session is a learning session, and only when the student who checked in during one continuous learning session, the data will be used for modelling. For example, if a student who checked in during a studio session, however, this student didn’t stay till the end of the session and watched the recordings later, then the data will not be used for modelling. (I need to rephrase this part in a clearer way but hopefully the idea makes sense for now.)</p>

<p>The plan for exploration:</p>

<ol>
  <li>filter the data only containing the check-in data during the studio sessions (Monday morning 9:00 am - 11:00 am).</li>
  <li>filter the check-ins only alligned with the studio session time when lecturers finished presenting the content and asked students for a check-in.</li>
  <li>also investigating why some students have more check-in than expected. Did they just randomly run the cell and didn’t really check in?</li>
  <li>visualise the confidence levels of each participant</li>
  <li>modelling confidence levels</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s use week 7 data as an example.</p>

<p>Some notes from the data preparation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>44 students checked in during the studio session.</li>
  <li>all the checkins are from the correct notebook.</li>
  <li>Andrew and Luisa might have different pace for the 4 check-ins, here are the time when they introduced each check-in:
    <ul>
      <li>Andrew: 9:23, 9:32, 9:43, 10:40</li>
      <li>Luisa: 9:25, 9:39, 9:44, 10:40</li>
      <li>so the paces were quite similar. Mind that some students might check in before or after the lecturers introduced the check-ins.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Looks like a few students checked in around 10:15 when there was no check-in. However, the gap between check-in 3 and check-in 4 was quite long. So they might jump around while the lecturers were demonstrating an example. It also might be because they lost interest in the example, and it led to low participation in the last check-in.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="basic-visualisation">Basic visualisation</h2>

<p>I plotted each individual student’s confidence level during the studio session. The confidence levels were plotted in the order of time. There were 44 subplots so it will be too large to share here. Here I combined all the subplots into one plot.</p>

<div class="l-page">
  <iframe src="/assets/plotly/fig_303_wk7_checkin_time_distribution.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="600px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Looks like most students’ self report confidence levels were quite random, or there were no changes to their confidence levels during the session. Some of the reported data were not accurate, as they tended to log multiple times in short period of time, and the times of their logs didn’t match with the time when lecturers introduced the check-ins.</p>

<p>In general, most students’ confidence levels stayed the same during the session. A few reported their levels dropped towards the end of the session.</p>

<p>Here is a question: can I trust the self-reported data?</p>
