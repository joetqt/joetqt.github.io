<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

<p>This was initially a short presentation to the IFN619 class - Semester 1, 2023. The initial purpose of this project page is to inform the students who opted in to provide their Jupyter telemetry data from the IFN619 class.</p>

<p>If you are a participant of this project, please contact me if you want to know more about this project. 
I will keep updating this project page as I dig more into the telemetry data.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My PhD topic is about identifying and supporting curiosity in learning with a data-driven approach.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Telemetry data from JupyterLab environment is collected. All the data are anonymous.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My hypothesis: students behave differently; different patterns will correlate with features signifying curiosity.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Data from 96 out of 98 students (2 students never opened any studio notebooks?)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some students were using their local machines. Those students might only use the Jupyter environment to sync notebooks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wide range of activities by students. Do they have different patterns of using those studio notebooks?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Most of the events from the top 6 are reflected in the common use of notebooks for general exploration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a <strong>high rate of errors</strong>. What could be the potential reasons? Are these errors from a few students or all students? What types of errors are common, and are there any variations in the types of errors among students?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are <strong>not many “add cell” events</strong>. Is this because students do not need to add new cells for studio notebooks? Who added cells and when did they do so?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be interesting to investigate <strong>copy/cut/paste activities</strong>. Did these activities occur only among some students? Where did they copy and paste the code from?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Running into errors is quite common for most students.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be able to provide more insights if I standardise each student’s activities on the same scale (by looking at the proportion of each event). See below…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The behavioural patterns might differ depending on whether the notebook is a solution or not. This needs to be examined at the individual level.</p>

    <p>A few students’ activity patterns seemed to be different, for example, #185, #190, #188, and #181.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might also be because they didn’t use the Jupyter environment as their main platform.</p>

    <p>This needs to be investigated at the individual level to find out.</p>

<h1 id="a-more-comprehensive-analysis-work-in-progress">A more comprehensive analysis (work in progress)</h1>

<p>This section records all the steps I am taking to analyse the telemetry data. Since this is a work in progress, the contents below may not be consistent. I will try to update as much as I can to have a clear flow. Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>

<p>I continued to use the code from previous analysis. The first step is to combine all the data into a single file with a tabular format. 
As mentioned above, one activity (such as a click by a student) is recorded as a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSON</code> file, including the event and many information associated with the event. 
Since there are around <strong>7.7 millions</strong> of files, it will take a long time to process all the data. However, I only extracted the information I consider to be important to my study at this stage, including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">event_name</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">session_id</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">session_seq</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">request_time</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user_id</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">error_name</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">error_value</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">notebook_name</code>. Below is a short description of those variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">event_name</code>: The name of an event from a student interacting with the Jupyter Notebook. 14 events are recorded in the data:
    <ul>
      <li>open_notebook</li>
      <li>close_notebook</li>
      <li>save_notebook</li>
      <li>notebook_visible</li>
      <li>notebook_hidden</li>
      <li>scroll</li>
      <li>cell_executed</li>
      <li>active_cell_changed</li>
      <li>add_cell</li>
      <li>remove_cell</li>
      <li>cell_errored</li>
      <li>clipboard_copy</li>
      <li>clipboard_paste</li>
      <li>clipboard_cut</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">session_id</code>: Every time a student opens a Jupyter Notebook triggers a “session”. If a student opens multiple notebooks in the Jupyter environment, multiple sessions will be generated.</li>
  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">session_seq</code>: Each event within a session is assigned a session sequence. Since a student can open multiple notebooks, resulting in multiple sessions recorded simultaneously. Therefore, we consider session sequences as a linear process.</li>
  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">request_time</code>: Timestamp of the event occurred. All the time are UTC time. Later, I will convert the time into Brisbane time to align with the class times.</li>
  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user_id</code>: In the raw data, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user_id</code> is the QUT student ID. As part of the ethical considerations, I will not use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user_id</code> as the unique identifier. I will replace the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user_id</code> with randomly generated ID numbers so student identities remain unrevealed. Please note, only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">open_notebook</code> event files recorded <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user_id</code>, therefore, I have to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">session_id</code> to link all other events to the same user.</li>
  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">error_name</code>: Events only recorded when an error is occurred in a Jupyter Notebook.</li>
  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">error_value</code>: The error message displayed when an error is occurred.</li>
  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">notebook_name</code>: This is the new feature this semester. It records the name of the Jupyter Notebook the event was triggered. Recording the notebook names is important for my project as different types of events may associated with different types of notebooks. For example, for a studio notebook, students may follow the steps of a lecture and fill the gaps as they listen to the lecture; for a tutorial notebook, students will try some code by themselves. Therefore, you would imagine the majority of events for a studio notebook will be executing cells, while a tutorial notebook will have a wider variety of events such as copying, pasting, running into errors, etc. This example is only considering the scenario during a learning experience by a student, it may change when assignments involved.</li>
</ul>

<p>After over 2 hours, all the raw data have been processed into a single csv file for cleaning and processing.</p>

<h3 id="data-preparation">Data preparation</h3>

<p>It is not too bad to reduce the size from the raw data (~250 GB) to the processed csv file (~750 MB). The raw data contains 7,685,002 rows of records. Below are some statistics and initial observations about the raw data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Observations on events:
    <ul>
      <li>The most frequent event is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scroll</code>. Top 3 also includes changing active cells and executing cells. This is expected as those three events are the most common activities when a user is using Jupyter Notebook.</li>
      <li>The least frequent events are closing notebooks and clipboard cut. This also makes sense, as users tend not to close their notebooks when they finish using the Jupyter environment (but they will remember to save their notebooks). They also tend to use “copy” instead of “cut” when getting information from one location to another.</li>
      <li>More “clipboard paste” events than the combination of “clipboard copy” and “clipboard cut”. More likely students copied information from other resources such as the Internet.</li>
      <li>Lots of errors occurred when using Jupyter notebooks (Top 4!).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Observations on sequences:
    <ul>
      <li>How long a student stayed within a notebook during a session varied significantly. The average events per session is 537.633, but the standard deviation is 833.919. The median is 243 but the max is 9865.</li>
      <li>The statisitics above doesn’t really mean anything as one person can have multiple sessions simultaneously. In addition, depending on what kind of notebooks, for example, students may spend more time in a session on their assignment notebook, and they might just open one studio notebook to quickly grab some information.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Events from 194 users are recorded. Please notes the teaching team and administrators are also included in the data. Those data will be removed during the data cleaning process.</li>
  <li>Observations on errors:
    <ul>
      <li>80 different types of errors occurred in the data. The top 5 errors are: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NameError</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SyntaxError</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KeyError</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ValueError</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TypeError</code>. All those “popular” errors seem to be quite common in using Jupyter notebooks, particularly for Python beginners.</li>
      <li>As mentioned above, errors took place very frequently in the records. Dig into how different students deal with errors might be beneficial to study curiosity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Observations on notebook names:
    <ul>
      <li>Not surprisingly, most events were generated in the assignment notebooks. Students generated also doubled amount of events in assignment 1 than in assignment 2.</li>
      <li>Students also spent a large amount of time on notebooks generated by themselves (as shown <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NaN</code>).</li>
      <li>More events were generated in the notebooks from earlier weeks of the semester, indicating students might have tended to spend more time studying in the beginning of a semester. However, since the notebooks from earlier the semester were released early, we also need to consider the length of “availability” to students. So we cannot really make that statement that students spending more time in the beginning of the semester.</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, students tended to spend more time on studio notebooks than tutorial notebooks. The least visited notebooks are the solutions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Above information may not be accurate because there are lots of issues in the raw data. The next step will be clean the data and some exploratory data analysis as data cleaning progresses.</p>

<h3 id="data-cleaning">Data cleaning</h3>

<p>Steps as listed below were taken to clean the data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As mentioned earlier, only files from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">open_notebook</code> events recorded the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user_id</code>. In addition, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">open_notebook</code> events are the first event of each session, therefore, it always shows as 0 in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">session_seq</code>. Each session was automatically assigned a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">session_id</code>. The first step is to fill the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na</code> values from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user_id</code> column based on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">session_id</code> information.</li>
  <li>Once all the users were identified in the dataset, I then replaced the real IDs with some computer-generated IDs. Therefore, no student identities can be identified from the analysis.</li>
  <li>Since nobody opted out from the experiment, no action was taken to remove any records from the dataset.</li>
  <li>During the semester, a filter was applied to only include the studio notebooks in the analysis. The studio notebooks can be identified by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">notebook_name</code> column. Since the semester for IFN619, semester 1 concluded, this filter does not need to be applied for the analysis.</li>
  <li>Note that the student list was from week 3, therefore, if any students who enrolled after week 3 were not included in the analysis (as proposed in the ethics application). In addition, some students might drop out of the unit after week 3. For those students, I will apply a filter to check when was their last activity in the Jupyter environment. No further activities after the census day are considered to be inactive and will not be included in the analysis. There were 193 users in the Jupyter environment, including teaching staff. The next step is to remove inactive students.</li>
  <li>In order to compare dates, I need to convert <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">request_time</code> column to a datetime data type. I have also convert the datetime to Brisbane time as the original <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">request_time</code> used UTC time. The new column is named as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">datetime_bne</code>.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Based on the filter, 4 students dropped out of this unit before the census day. 4 students dropped out of this unit after the census day, before the first assignment is due. 1 student dropped out right before the date for “withdraw without an academic panelty”. So the following filter was applied to exclude those students (in the order of the filter):</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Students whose first activity didn’t happen until week 4 (after the census day). Which means those students didn’t use the Jupyter environment until week 4 (or even later). 12 students were excluded.</li>
      <li>Students who didn’t have any activities after withdrawing without academic penalty date. 14 student was excluded.</li>
      <li>Teaching staff members and Jupyter administrator were excluded. 6 staff members were excluded.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the end, <strong>data from a total of 161 students will be included in the analysis</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: this part will be updated as the analysis progresses.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>It’s important to categorise different types of notebook, a new column is added to the dataframe called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">notebook_category</code>. The categories are: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">studio</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tutorial</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">solution</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assignment</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self-generated</code>. Please note all the notebooks that are not provided from the unit are considered as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self-generated</code>.</li>

<h3 id="what-is-the-notebook-usage-like">What is the notebook usage like?</h3>

<div class="l-page">
  <iframe src="/assets/plotly/fig_notebook_usage.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="600px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Interpretation of the plot above:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The notebooks were opened by most students are assignment 1, self-generated notebooks, and the first studio notebook.</li>
  <li>The solutions were the least viewed notebooks.</li>
  <li>In general, studio notebooks were opened by more students than the tutorial notebooks.</li>
  <li>Also keep in mind that the notebooks were released at different times. Some notebooks were released towards the end of the semester, so it is less likely to be opened by more students.</li>
  <li>It was interesting to see that solutions were the least visited notebooks. This could be because they received solutions by participating in the studio and tutorial sessions? Or they didn’t bother to look after the sessions?</li>
  <li>Even though the self-generated notebooks can be used as a good indication of students’ curiosity, however, it might not be accurate. Based on some conversations with students, some students used the Jupyter environment to complete assignments from other units. So I will exclude self-generated notebooks from some of the analysis – particularly the ones involving counting the number of notebooks opened by each student.</li>
  <li>In addition to the point above, self-generated notebooks are not one single notebook, instead, it is a collection of notebooks. Therefore, it is reasonable to exclude them from some analysis. However, later when we are looking for relationship between notebooks, it is important to include self-generated notebooks.</li>
</ul>

<p>It will be useful to know how often each notebook has been used. This can be achieved by counting the number of sessions each notebook has been opened. Again, since the notebooks were released at different times, it is not fair to compare the number of sessions, but it will give some ideas about the usage of each notebook.</p>

<div class="l-page">
  <iframe src="/assets/plotly/fig_notebook_session_count_vs_user_count.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="500px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Interpretation of the plot above:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Students spent more time working on Assessment 1 than Assessment 2. However, they might use assessment 1 as a reference for their assessment 2.</li>
  <li>The self-generated notebooks were used the most. This is because ALL other notebooks were generated from the self-generated notebooks.</li>
  <li>Lots of solution notebooks never been opened by some students.</li>
  <li>Module A and Module B were the most frequently used notebooks. This might be because there were released at the beginning of the semester.</li>
  <li>[IDEA] It might be useful to see when a notebook was used the most. A heatmap over time might be useful.</li>
</ul>

<div class="l-page">
  <iframe src="/assets/plotly/fig_notebook_usage_heatmap.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="600px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Since the data were quite skewed – students spent much more time on their assignment notebook. So to emphasise the differences in less frequently used notebooks, I chose to use a logarithmic scale to plot the data.</p>

<ul>
  <li>[IDEA] add information about the date when the notebooks were released (in the plot and in the dataframe). And add assignment deadlines to the plot.</li>
</ul>
