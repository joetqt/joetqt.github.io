I am a PhD candidate in QUT’s School of Information Systems, a participant in QUT’s [Centre for Data Science](https://research.qut.edu.au/qutcds/staff/joe-tang/), and a member of the QUT’s [Cognitive Science research group](https://research.qut.edu.au/cognitivescience/). My PhD project focuses on using a data-driven approach to identify and support curiosity in learning, aiming to explore how curiosity influences learner behaviour through big data analytics. 

My journey into data began during the COVID job restructure, which prompted me to actively participate in data-related activities. Before starting my PhD, I also worked as a data analyst for six months.

In addition to my full time PhD commitment, I am involving in tutoring. Fortunately, I have the opportunity to tutor in several units at QUT that I am interested in:

- Data Analytics for Strategic Decision Makers
- Data Analytics for Business Insight
- Human Information Interaction
- Fundamentals of Data Science
- Systems Analysis and Design

Outside of campus, I enjoy running. I started running with a few friends at the end of 2022 with the goal of losing some weight. Recently, I accomplished my first half marathon at the [Brisbane Marathon Festival 2023](https://results.sportseventservices.com.au/myresults.aspx?uid=16287-6267-2-520172). I am currently continuing my training with the aim of completing my first full marathon in 2024. On average, I run 4-5 times a week, covering distances from 5km to 25km per run. If you share the same passion for running and are looking for a running buddy, feel free to get in touch with me!
