# Week 2 learning check-in data

*Note: The following information was as accurate as on  2023-08-08 10:45:52 (the last activity in the dataset after syncing).*

On week 2, learning check-ins were embedded in the studio notebook. Students were encouraged to check in at 4 points of time during the studio session with the lecturers. After syncing the data on 2023-08-08, here is some general information I found (**before cleaning the data** - so the data might not be as accurate, but will give you some idea about the data): 

- There are 4 check-ins in the notebook. 
- Data for 123 students were recorded. >> We have 142 students enrolled, which means 19 students haven't even used the Jupyter environment. 
- 56 students completed at least 1 check-in. >> Less than half of the students used the check-in function :'(
- Most students were confident - as most students had a mean confidence level above 8 (see plot below).
- 13 students completed at least 4 check-ins. The majority checked in 3 times. 25 students checked in once or twice. However, at this stage, not all check-ins are genuine. I need to do more data cleaning.

**[INSERT PLOT]**

## Check-ins during Week 2 studio sessions

This is the first experience of student learning check-in. The information below only used the data from week 2's studio notebook and included the activities during the studio session (Monday morning 9:00 am - 11:00 am). Later, I may check the data again and I may include data from outside the studio session time. The new data may provide some information about students who watched the recordings or attempted the tasks by themselves outside the studio session time. :

- 34 students checked in at least once during the live studio sessions. 
- Only 4 students completed all 4 check-ins during the studio session. 
- In general, students were quite confident about their learning for the session, as the mean confidence levels for a majority of students were above 7.  
- By roughly observing individual inputs, there were not many changes in the confidence levels during the session. This might be because there were not enough check-ins for the session to show some patterns. 

Potential issues that need to be solved:

- Some students ran the check-in code in other notebooks
- One student ran 4 check-ins within 2 minutes

What else to do:

- Visualise the confidence levels of each participant
- Modelling confidence levels
- A more close examination of the time spans for check-ins 
- Adding students who checked in outside the studio session
