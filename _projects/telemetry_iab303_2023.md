# Learning check-in during Week 2 studio sessions

This is the first experience of student learning check-in. The information below only used the data from week 2's studio notebook and included the activities during the studio session (Monday morning 9:00 am - 11:00 am). Later, I may check the data again and I may include data from outside the studio session time. The new data may provide some information about students who watched the recordings or attempted the tasks by themselves outside the studio session time. 

- There are 4 check-ins in the notebook. 
- 46 students opened their studio notebooks. 
- 34 students completed at least 1 check-in. Only 4 students completed all 4 check-ins during the studio session. 
- In general, students were quite confident about their learning for the session, as the mean confidence levels for a majority of students were above 7.  
- By roughly observing individual inputs, there were not many changes in the confidence levels during the session. This might be because there were not enough check-ins for the session to show some patterns. 

Potential issues that need to be solved:

- Some students ran the check-in code in other notebooks
- One student ran 4 check-ins within 2 minutes

What else to do:

- Visualise the confidence levels of each participant
- Modelling confidence levels
- A more close examination of the time spans for check-ins 
- Adding students who checked in outside the studio session
